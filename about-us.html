                <p>The wild life of Endangered Species is a nonprofit organization that focuses on the health care of many stuggling wild life species.
Our mission is to find wild animals in different parts of the country and give them the neccessary health care they need. We provide food and shelter in remote parts of the country to all animals that live in the wild. It is so crucial to our organization because an endangered specie means that it is likely to be extinct. Many factors are considered when assessing the life status of a species. For example we check the statistics of the number of animals remaining of each specie. We also analize the overall increase or decrease in the population of the specie over time. Further more, we check out the breeding success rates and known threats to each specie. Our locations are in South Asia, South Central China and North America.
