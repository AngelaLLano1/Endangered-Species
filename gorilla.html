      <h2>Gorilla</h2>
      <p>All species (and sub-species) of gorilla are listed as Critically Endangered on the IUCN Red List. ... Mountain gorillas are the most severely endangered, with an estimated population of about 880 left in the wild and none in zoos. Threats to gorilla survival include habitat destruction and poaching for the bushmeat trade.
Gorillas move around by knuckle-walking, although they sometimes walk bipedally for short distances while carrying food or in defensive situations. Wild male gorillas weigh  300 to 400 lbs, while adult females usually weigh half as much as adult males at 150 to 250 lbs. Adult males are 5ft to 7 inches tall, with an arm span that stretches from  7ft to 7 inches or  8ft to 6 inches. Female gorillas are shorter, with smaller arm spans. Adult male gorillas are known as silverbacks due to the characteristic silver hair on their backs reaching to the hips.
